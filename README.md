## Smith Waterman

Implementing read mapping stepwise involves the following steps:
1) Indexing: Indexing the reference genome using hashing.
2) Global Positioning: Determining the global positions of the reads in the indexed reference genome.
3) Pairwise Alignment: This step is the most time-consuming in read mapping algorithms. Here, we are implementing the Smith-Waterman algorithm using Biopython for pairwise alignment.

## Needleman Wunsch

The Needleman Wunsch Pairwise Alignment Algorithm is implemented from stratch on any two input sequences.
